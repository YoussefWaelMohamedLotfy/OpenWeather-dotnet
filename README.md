# OpenWeather .NET SDK

A wrapper for [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/) for .NET Core Projects.

API Endpoints for Current Weather Data can be found at [the API docs page](https://openweathermap.org/current).

Check the [`samples` folder](https://github.com/YoussefWaelMohamedLotfy/OpenWeather-dotnet/tree/main/samples) for examples on how to add the package in your Console and ASP.NET app.

## Supported Platforms

The library currently supports .NET 6 only.

## Installing the package

You need to add the nuget Source Registry in your IDE to be able to find the package, as this package is published in the Github NuGet Registry.

In VS Community, Go to `Tools -> Options -> NuGet Package Manager -> Package Sources` and add this in the Source `https://nuget.pkg.github.com/YoussefWaelMohamedLotfy/index.json` and give it a name.
